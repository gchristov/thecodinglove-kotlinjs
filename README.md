# About

`thecodinglove-kotlinjs` is a cutting-edge Kotlin multiplatform project, powering [TheCodingLove GIFs](https://slack.com/apps/AFNEWBNFN) Slack app. Built with [KotlinJS](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/js-overview.html), it seamlessly bridges Kotlin and Javascript to bring a fully serverless platform, currently deployed as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/run).

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to setup the project locally and in the cloud. Currently, the project is configured for Google Cloud and expects the following bits to be setup before you can run it locally:
- Service account for [PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub). The actual publisher and subscribers are automatically setup in code.
- [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)

### Cloud setup

<details>
  <summary>Using Google Cloud</summary>

1. Create a new Google Cloud project
2. Enable the following APIs:
   - `Cloud Pub/Sub API`, used for communication between services
   - `Cloud Firestore API`, used for data storage
3. Setup Firestore:
   - Create a new Firestore database in Google Cloud
   - Navigate to your Firestore database -> Security rules
   - Click `Enable Firebase` to allow editing of the rules. This will add two service accounts to your project:
      - `firebase-adminsdk-5-random-chars@projectname.iam.gserviceaccount.com` - provides credentials for the Firebase Admin SDK. We will use this account's API key in the code so you can rename it to something clearer, like `App backend`
      - `firebase-service-account@firebase-sa-management.iam.gserviceaccount.com` - manages and links Firebase services to Google Cloud projects
   - Navigate to your project in Firebase -> Firebase Database -> Rules and paste the following setup
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
         match /{document=**} {
            // The backend uses the Firebase Admin SDK, so external access is disabled  
            allow read, write: if false;
         }
      }
   }
   ```
4. Navigate to IAM and admin and give your `firebase-adminsdk` account the following additional roles
   - `Pub/Sub Admin`, for managing the PubSub subscriptions
5. Create a new API key for your `firebase-adminsdk` service account and save it locally.

### API setup

<details>
  <summary>For Slack</summary>

The project powers an [existing Slack app](https://slack.com/apps/AFNEWBNFN), so you'll need one in order to run it. 

1. Create a new Slack app
2. You will need an SSH tunnel to your localhost for Slack. You can use [serveo.net](http://serveo.net) for free and configure it with this command `ssh -R YOUR_DOMAIN.serveo.net:80:localhost:3000 serveo.net`.
3. Point the following Slack features to the relevant project APIs that know how to respond to them using the url you used for [serveo.net](http://serveo.net):
   - [Slash commands](https://api.slack.com/slash-commands) -> `YOUR_DOMAIN.serveo.net/api/slack/slash`
   - [OAuth](https://api.slack.com/authentication/oauth-v2) -> `YOUR_DOMAIN.serveo.net/api/slack/auth`
   - [Events](http://api.slack.com/events-api) -> `YOUR_DOMAIN.serveo.net/api/slack/event`
   - [Interactivity](https://api.slack.com/messaging/interactivity) -> `YOUR_DOMAIN.serveo.net/api/slack/interactivity`
4. Note down your Slack Client ID, Secret and Signing Secret

### Local setup

Ensure you complete the previous sections first, as you will need to provide some values to the project as environment variables.

<details>
  <summary>Required tooling</summary>

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and start it up. No additional configuration is required as the project sets up its own image and cleans up the containers after each run
2. [Install IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html). This project has been tested with `IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2.5`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Project installation</summary>

Just clone the repository and open the project with IntelliJ. That's it!
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Local environment</summary>

1. Create a `env.properties` file at the root of the project with the following contents
```
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=YOUR_SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET
SLACK_REQUEST_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=true|false
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SLACK_CLIENT_ID
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET
SLACK_INTERACTIVITY_PUBSUB_TOPIC=TOPIC_NAME
SLACK_SLASH_COMMAND_PUBSUB_TOPIC=TOPIC_NAME
SLACK_MONITORING_URL=YOUR_SLACK_MONITORING_URL
APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug|verbose|error|info
APP_NETWORK_HTML_LOG_LEVEL=all|info|none
APP_NETWORK_JSON_LOG_LEVEL=all|info|none
APP_PUBLIC_URL=YOUR_PUBLIC_APP_URL
SEARCH_PRELOAD_PUBSUB_TOPIC=TOPIC_NAME
```
2. Create a `credentials-gcp-app.json` file at the root of the project with the contents of a new JSON API key for the `firebase-adminsdk` service account you created previously.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Dependencies</summary>

Dependencies are automatically pulled when the project is ran. Updating dependency versions requires `./gradlew kotlinUpgradeYarnLock` to be executed manually in order for the lock file to be updated.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Monitoring</summary>

The project is configured to report all `Throwable`s to a Slack channel specified via the `SLACK_MONITORING_URL` environment variable. This is mainly used for stability monitoring.
</details>

## Run locally

After completing the above setup, you should be able to run the project locally. There are two ways to run the app:
// TODO: Fix this
- run the `TheCodingLove` IntelliJ IDE configuration
- run the `scripts/run_local.sh` script from a Terminal

## CI and cloud deployment

This is really up to you! However we've provided the existing setup for the project below.

<details>
  <summary>Using GitHub Actions</summary>

The project is configured to build with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). Checkout the `.github` folder for the workflows. Follow these steps to configure the CI environment:

1. Enable the following additional APIs on your Google Cloud project
   - `Cloud Run API`, used to run the final Docker container
   - `Artifact Registry API`, used to store the final Docker container
2. Create Service Account with these permissions for CI deployment
   - `Service Account User`
   - `Artifact Registry Administrator`
   - `Cloud Run Admin`
3. Each of the variables defined in `env.properties` should be exposed as [GitHub encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) using the same keys.
3. Add an additional `GCP_SA_KEY_DEPLOY` GitHub encrypted secret, containing the raw JSON API key for the CI deployment service account
4. Add an additional `GCP_SA_KEY_APP` GitHub encrypted secret, containing the raw JSON API key for the `firebase-adminsdk` service account

Once this is setup, for this project:
- opening pull requests against the repo triggers build and test checks
- merging pull requests to the main branch deploys the changes to Google Cloud;
