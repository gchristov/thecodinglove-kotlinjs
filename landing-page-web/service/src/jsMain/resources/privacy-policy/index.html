                    this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your

                <p class="p-small">Some of our products are based within Slack and integrate tightly with the Slack
                    service. Almost all of the data that these apps collect originates from within Slack.<br/><br/>Similarly,
                    The Coding Love GIFs is an app for the Slack service and as such, you may find it useful to review
                    the relevant Slack policies including the Slack privacy policy. You can find it at: <a
                            href="https://slack.com/legal">https://slack.com/legal<br/><br/>‍</a>The data that you
                    instruct Slack to pass to The Coding Love GIFs is stored, so that interaction with the Slack API is
                    possible and core functionality within our applications is possible through the data you give to one
                    of our apps, including access tokens, team, channel and user metadata.  <br/><br/>By design, our
                    product has very little access to the data in your Slack workspace: it cannot view any messages or
                    activities in any of your channels or conversations and also does not have access to any of your

                    You also have the right to contact a regulatory body or local data protection authority in relation
                    to your complaint.<br/><br/>Automatic deletion: We automatically purge all collected Slack access
