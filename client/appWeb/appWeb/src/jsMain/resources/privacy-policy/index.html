It is The Coding Love GIFs&#x27; policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect from you across all our websites and software we own and operate. Our products are designed to use the minimum amount of data required to run the service and collect analytics to improve them.<br /><br />If there’s any reason you don’t agree with this privacy policy, please don’t use our services, which include anything that The Coding Love GIFs creates, owns and operates.<br /><br />We will only process personal information in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation which for the purposes of this privacy policy shall mean: (i) UK GDPR (the retained EU law version of the General Data Protection Regulation ((EU) 2016/679), together with the UK Data Protection Act 2018) and (ii) any other privacy legislation worldwide, applicable to The Coding Love GIFs.<br /><br />Where you contract with us to provide the service to you, we will act as data processor and you will act as data controller. This privacy policy forms the basis of the instructions to us, under which we will process relevant personal data, and comply with GDPR.<br /><br />Any reference to &quot;you&quot; throughout, shall be deemed to refer to underlying data subjects for which you are a data controller, as appropriate.<br /></p>

            <h5>Log data<br /></h5>
            <p class="p-small">When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser. It may include your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on each page, and other details.<br /></p>
          </div>
          <div class="m-p-30">
            <h5>Personal information<br /></h5>
            <p class="p-small">This means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). <br /><br />We may ask for, or may receive from Slack (if you’re using one of our Slack apps) after your approval, personal information, such as your:<br /></p>

          <div class="m-p-30">
            <h5>Business data<br /></h5>
            <p class="p-small">Business data refers to data that accumulates over the normal course of operation on our platform. This may include stored files, user profiles, analytics data and other metrics, as well as other types of information, created or generated, as users interact with our services. Some of our products may receive information about you through platforms such as Slack.<br /><br />We may also collect, use and share aggregated data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal data in law as this data does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website or product feature. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy. We do not collect any special categories of personal data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data). Nor do we collect any information about criminal convictions and offences.<br /></p>
            <h5>Storage<br /></h5>
            <p class="p-small">Our main hosting providers are DigitalOcean and MongoDB Atlas to protect and store your information. They’re updated regularly and follow the latest global security standards in data protection and privacy. Whenever you act with one of our services, your data is protected and encrypted both at rest and in transit and transmitted through secure connections.<br /></p>
          </div>
          <div class="m-p-30">
            <h4>2. Legal bases for processing<br /></h4>
            <p class="p-small">We will process your personal information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner. We collect and process information about you only where we have legal bases for doing so.<br /><br />These legal bases depend on the services you use and how you use them, meaning we collect and use your information only where:<br /></p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>
                <p class="p-small">it’s necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (for example, when we provide a service you request from us);<br /></p>

              <li>
                <p class="p-small">it satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, and to protect our legal rights and interests;<br /></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="p-small">you give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or<br /></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="p-small">we need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.<br /></p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="p-small">Where you consent to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time (but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place).<br /><br />We don’t keep personal information for longer than is necessary. While we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and cannot guarantee absolute data security. If necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal obligation or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.<br /></p>

          <div class="m-p-30">
            <h4>3. Collection and use of information<br /></h4>
            <p class="p-small">We may collect, hold, use and disclose information for the following purposes and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:<br /></p>
            <ol role="list" class="list">
              <li>
                <p class="p-small">to provide you with our platform’s core features; and<br /></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="p-small">for internal record keeping and administrative purposes.<br /></p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="p-small">If you are a customer, you will only be contacted if you agree to it (by agreeing to this privacy policy). In addition, if you don&#x27;t want us to use your personal data for any of the other reasons set out in this privacy policy, you can let us know at any time by <a id="contact_email_1">contacting us</a>, and we will delete your data from our systems. However, you acknowledge this will limit our ability to provide any service to you.<br /></p>
          </div>

            <h5>The Coding Love GIFs &amp; Slack<br /></h5>
            <p class="p-small">Some of our products are based within Slack and integrate tightly with the Slack service. Almost all of the data that these apps collect originates from within Slack.<br /><br />Similarly, The Coding Love GIFs is an app for the Slack service and as such, you may find it useful to review the relevant Slack policies including the Slack privacy policy. You can find it at: <a href="https://slack.com/legal">https://slack.com/legal<br /><br />‍</a>The data that you instruct Slack to pass to The Coding Love GIFs is stored, so that interaction with the Slack API is possible and core functionality within our applications is possible through the data you give to one of our apps, including access tokens, team, channel and user metadata.  <br /><br />By design, our product has very little access to the data in your Slack workspace: it cannot view any messages or activities in any of your channels or conversations and also does not have access to any of your files. <br /></p>
          </div>
          <div class="m-p-30">
            <h4>4. Your rights and controlling your personal information<br /></h4>
            <p class="p-small">Choice and consent: By providing personal information to us, you consent to us collecting, holding, using and disclosing your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy. <br /><br />Restrict: You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information. If you ask us to restrict or limit how we process your personal information, we will let you know how the restriction affects your use of our website or products and services.<br /><br />Access and data portability: You may request details of the personal information that we hold about you. You may request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Where possible, we will provide this information in CSV format or other easily readable machine format. You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you at any time. You may also request that we transfer this personal information to another third party.<br /><br />Correction: If you believe that any information we hold about you is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, please <a id="contact_email_2">get in touch</a>. We will take reasonable steps to correct any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, misleading or out of date.<br /><br />Notification of data breaches: We will comply with laws applicable to us in respect of any data breach.<br /><br />Complaints: If you believe that we have breached a relevant data protection law and wish to make a complaint, please <a id="contact_email_3">contact us</a> in the first instance and provide us with full details of the alleged breach. We will promptly investigate your complaint and respond to you, in writing, setting out the outcome of our investigation and the steps we will take to deal with your complaint. You also have the right to contact a regulatory body or local data protection authority in relation to your complaint.<br /><br />Automatic deletion: We automatically purge all collected Slack access tokens after 90 days to ensure customers stay protected and re-issue approvals periodically.<br /></p>
